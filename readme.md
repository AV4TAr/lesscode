# Inspiration
Inspired by the Jon Bakus paper [Can programming be liberated...](https://github.com/van001/lesscode/blob/master/can-programming-be-liberated.pdf), this is my first attempt to define a functional library that could be applied to solve problems in variety of domain. 

My design goal is to influence programmers thinking in terms of functional programming and constructing program structure using pure fucntion(as much as) and function composition (lego blocks), which means using fewer data-strucutures and tools to solve variety of complex problems.
