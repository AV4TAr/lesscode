#Inspiration
Inspired by the Jon Bakus paper "Can programming be liberated...", I have made an initial attempt to define a functional librarary that could be applied to to solve problems in variety of domain. 

My design goal is to bring FP to genral progrommers and so I will try to explain many mathematical concepts behind the design in a simple and plain english.

Initially my goal is to try to solve as many algorithm and atastrustures questions using pure functional programming (as much as possible).

This is a work in progress effort a
