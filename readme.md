# Inspiration
Inspired by the Jon Bakus paper '[Can programming be liberated...](https://github.com/van001/lesscode/blob/master/can-programming-be-liberated.pdf)', this is my first attempt to define a functional library that could be applied to solve complex problems in variety of industry/ domain. 

My design goal is to influence programmers thinking in terms of functional programming and constructing program structure using pure fucntion(as much as) and function composition (lego blocks), which means using fewer data-strucutures and tools to solve variety of complex problems.

# Philosophy

# Approach
I will try to solve [common algorithm and interview questions](https://github.com/van001/lesscode/tree/master/nodejs/excercise) using FP and see if it's possible to stick to the [design principles outlined below](https://github.com/van001/lesscode/blob/master/readme.md#Design). I will use javscript for the initial implementation but the goal is to come up with functional construct that is independent of language and can be implemented in any language that supports functional programming.
